Api? 
Intermediate agent that allows two or more applications to communicate 
with each other.  

types: private(used within org), partner(used by partner/client), 
public(third party services)

e.g.: application(consumer) -- google Map API -- gmap(provider)

application contact api and gmap exposes its services via api 

With api we can have single db and multiple applications(web, android, ..)
If i want to create a adnroid application of my website. Then that android
app to work, what all services are required are exposed via api.

Web API? 
Api which is interface for web is web api. It may consist of one or more 
endpoints to define request and response.


How web API works? 
clientWeb(HTTP request) -- api -- webapp/db
client makes http request to api. api communicate to db. 
db provides required date to api. api returns data to client.   

data returned is in json or xml format. 

How to use public web API in general?  
register to API
API prvides api key apiKey: 274848hdjvb838823
Whenever you need kto communicate with server make request with api key 
e.g.: http://vector.com/?key=274848hdjvb838823
If API key aunthentication succeed, API will provide required data. 


REST:
It is just an architectural guideline to develop webapi.

REST API:
The api which is developed using REST is know an REST API/ RESTful API. 

CRUD:
Operation - HTTP_methods - Description  
Create - POST - Creating/posting/inserting data
Read - GET
Update - PUT,PATCH - PUT for complete data to be updated, PATCH for partial update 
delete - DELETE - Deleting data 

e.g.:
http://geekyshows.com/api/students
Suppose to use student data api we have been provided above link 
by UGC(org which keeps all university students data). 
api services student data.

http://geekyshows.com/api/students
Base url: geekyshows.com
naming convention: api
endpoint: students

requests: 
GET: /api/students     will return json data [{'id:1', 'name':'rahul'}, {'id:2', 'name':'amit'}] 
request single student data
GET: /api/students/1   will return [{'id:1', 'name':'yash'}

POST: api/students  
{'name': 'anket'}   will insert data [{'id':11, 'name':'anket'}]


Django REST framework: 
It is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building WebApis.

Why to use DRF?
- You can test api while building it 
- You get OAuth1, OAuth2 packages in Authentication policies 
- Serialization supports both ORM and non ORM data sources. 

pip install djangorestframework 

INstalled_apps = [
'rest_framework'
]


prerequieste for - Serializers
Python-json
python has a builtin package called json used to work with json data.

.dumps(data)- This is used to convert python object into json string.
e.g.: 
import json
python_data = {'name':'amit', 'rollno':100}
json_data = json.dumps(python_data)
print(json_Data) ==> {"name":"amit", "rollno":100}
// json data is always in double quotes ""

.loads(data)- This is used to parse json string.
e.g.: 
json_data = {"name":"amit", "rollno":100}
parsed_data = json.loads(json_data)
print(parsed_data) ==> {'name':'amit', 'rollno':100}


Serializers:
serializers are responsible for converting complex data such as querysets
or model objects to native python datatypes called serialization. That can
be easily rendered into JSON, XML or other content types which is easily 
understandable by Front End. 

Serializers are also responsible for desrialization which means it allows
parsed data to be converted back into complex types, after first 
validating incoming data.     

Serializer class: 
DRF provides a Serializer class which gives you a powerful, generic way
to control the ouput of your responses.

How to create serializer class?
Create a seprate serializer.py file to write all serializers.

from rest_framework import serializers
class StudentSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
	name = serializers.CharField(max_length=100)
	rollno = serializers.IntegerField()
	city = serializers.CharField(max_length=100)

Flow of serializing data present in db:
translate the db data to json form and send it to client 
similarly, convert the json data comming from client to python datatype. 

We have records in table.
records means model objects 
model objects means complex data. 

complex Dataype---(a)--->Python Native DataType---(b)--->Json Data
a= seriialization, b = render into json
	
e.g.: 
 //Creating a model instance stu 
1) stu = Student.objects.get(id=1)
      //Converting a model instance stu to Python Dict/ Serializing object
2) serializer = StudentSerializer(stu)

//Creating a query set 
stu = Student.objects.all()
//Converting a queryset to list of python Dict/ Serializing queryset
serializer = StudentSerializer(stu, many=True)

* serializer.data 
This will show you the serialized data/python dict. 

* JSONRenderer
This is used to render serialized data into JSON which is understandable 
by FRONT end.

How to render serialized data into JSON using JSONRendered? 
from rest_framework.renderers import JSONRenderer
3) json_data = JSONRenderer().render(serializer.data)
// you can also use json.dumps() 

In 1) ,2) ,3) setps you extract data from db, serialize data, 
render serialized data into json.

* JsonResponse
JsonResponse(data, encoder=DjangoJSONEncoder, safe=True, 
		json_dumps_params=None, **kwargs)
- An httpResponse subclass that helps to create a JSON-encoded reponse. 
- Its default content type is set to application/json.
- The encoder is used to serialize the data.
- When safe is set to True, dict has to be passed, else raise typeerror. 
  if false any object is allowed. 


Serializer Fields: 
serializable fields are used in serializers to convert complex data 
types (like Django models) into JSON, and vice versa.

1) CharField(max_length=None, min_length=None, allow_blank=False,
	 trim_whitespace=True)
2) IntegerField(max_value=None, min_value=None)
3) FloatField(max_value=None, min_value=None)
4) DecimalField(max_digits, decimal_places, coerce_to_string=None, 
	max_value=None, min_value=None)
5) SlugField(max_length=50, min_length=None, allow_blank=False)
6) EmailField(max_length=None, min_length=None, allow_blank=False)
7) BooleanField()
8) NullBooleanField()
9) URLField(max_length=200, min_length=None, allow_blank=False)
10) FileField(max_length=None, allow_empty_file=False, use_url=UPLOADED_FILES_USE_URL)
11) ImageField(max_length=None, allow_empty_file=False, use_url=UPLOADED_FILES_USE_URL)
12) DateField(format=api_settings.DATE_FORMAT, input_formats=None)
13) TimeField(format=api_settings.TIME_FORMAT, input_formats=None)
14) DateTimeField(format=api_settings.DATETIME_FORMAT, input_formats=None, default_timezone=None)
15) DurationField(max_value=None, min_value=None)
16) RegexField(regex, max_length=None, min_length=None, allow_blank=False)
17) UUIDField(format='hex_verbose')
18) FilePathField(path, match=None, recursive=False, allow_files=True, allow_folders=False, required=None, **kwargs)
19) IPAddressField(protocol='both', unpack_ipv4=False, **options)
20) ChoiceField(choices)
21) MultipleChoiceField(choices)
22) ListField(child=<A_FIELD_INSTANCE>, allow_empty=True, 
	min_length=None, max_length=None)
23) DictField(child=<A_FIELD_INSTANCE>, allow_empty=True)
24) HStoreField(child=<A_FIELD_INSTANCE>, allow_empty=True)
25) JSONField(binary, encoder)
26) ReadOnlyField()
27) HiddenField()
28) ModelField(model_field=<Django ModelField instance>)
29) SerializerMethodField(method_name=None)


Deserialization:
Serializers are also responsible for desrialization which means it allows
parsed data to be converted back into complex types, after first 
validating incoming data. 

flow? 
Json Data---(a)--->Python Native DataType---(b)--->complex Dataype
a: Parse Data 
b: Deserialization

Pre-requistes for Deserialization:
* BytesIO()
1) stream = io.BytesIO(json_data)
// will convert json_data to stream data/ continous flow of data/file 
like object.
This lets you process or parse the data as if it came from a file, 
making it easier to handle.

* JSONParser()
This let you parse json data to python native datatype. 
from rest_framework.parsers import JSONParser 
2) parsed_data = JSONParser().parse(stream)

Deserialization allows parsed data to be converted back into complex types, after first 
validating incoming data.

//Creating serializer Object 
3) serializer = StudentSerializer(data = parsed_data)
//validated data
4) serialize.is_valid()
// is_valid check if data is proper. e.g. max_length is satisfied, column is
integer depending on model definition. 

can view data using 
	> serializer.validated_data
	e.g.:
	{"name": "Amit", "roll": "100a", "city": "Mumbai"}
can view errors using 
	> serializer.errors 
	e.g.:
	{"name": "", "roll": "100a", "city": "Mumbai"}
	{'name': ['This field may not be blank.'], 'roll': ['A valid integer is required.']}

flow: we are converting json data to native python datatype
and then convert to complex datatype i.e. model object which can be insert 
into db table.  

When do we do deserialization ? 
when we want to insert, updatae, modify data sent from user. 
similarly, to get data we do serialization. 

Extra functions in serializer class while deserializing?
class StudentSreializer(serializers.Serializer):
	..

	def create(self, validated_data):
		return super().create(**validated_data)

Here validated_data contains dictionary. To pass dict you use **.  
This create method is executed when you call serializer.save(). This create
a new entry in table.  

CRUD operations with API: 
Till now we have seen Read, Create (GET, POST).
Update:
types?  
partial update 
complete update (all fields value)

Extra function in serializer class to update records? 
class StudentSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
	..
	
	def update(self, instance, validated_data):
		instance.name = validated_data.get('name', insatnce.name)
		insatnce.roll = validated_data.get('roll', instance.roll)
		instance.city = validated_data.get('city', insatnce.city)
		
		instance.save()
		return instance 

instance.name - old data stored in db 
validated_data - new data 

Complete update: 
originalModelObject = Student.objects.get(id=id) // entry to be updated  
serializer = StudentSerilaizer(originalModelObject, data=pythondata)
if serializer.is_valid()
	serializer.save()

Partial Update:
serializer = StudentSerializer(originalModelObject, data=pythondata, partial=True)
if serializer.is_valid():
	serializer.save()


Delete:
There is no extra function in StudentSreializer class to delete. 
Just identify the model object and delete. 
Student.objects.get(id=id).delete()

Function based View: 
def studentapi(request):
	if request.method == 'GET':
		..

urls.py 
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
	path('studentapi/', views.studentapi)
]



Class based Views:
from django.views import View 
class StudentAPI(View):
	def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
	// instead of if request.method == 'GET': we write functions
		.. 
		remaining code remains same 
	

urls.py 
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
	path('studentapi/', views.StudentAPI.as_view())
]



Validation:
types: 
-Field Level Validation 
-Object level 
-Validators

-Field Level Validation
We can specify field level validation by adding validate_fieldName()
methods to your Serializer subclass.
validate_filedName() method should return the validated value or raise
a serializers.ValidationError 
e.g.: 
class StudentSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
	name = serializers.CharField(max_length = 200)
	roll = serializers.IntegerField()
	city = serializers.CharField(max_length = 200)

	def validate_roll(self, value):
		if value >= 200:
			rasie serializers.ValidationError('Seat Full')
		return value 

//value is the value of the filed that need to be validated. 
//validate_roll is invoked when you call serialized_data.is_valid()

-Object Level Validation
When we need to do valdiation that requires multiple fields we do object 
level validation by adding method called validate() to Serialzer class.

validate() method should return the validated value or raise
a serializers.ValidationError 

e.g.:
def validate(self, data):
	name = data.get('name')
	city = data.get('city')
	if name.lower() == 'amit' and city.lower() != 'mumbai':
		raise serializers.ValidationError('City must be Mumbai')
	return data				
//data is dictionary of field values.


Validators:
You can create any function outside seriualzier class and mention it in serializer class field in validators paramete to
validate data.
e.g.:
	def starts_with_r(value):
	    if value['0'].lower() != 'r':
	       raise serializer.ValidationError('name dont start with r')

class StudentSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
	name = serializers.CharField(max_length=100,
				validators=[starts_with_r])

//Priority: 1) Validators, 2) field level validaton, 3) Object level
//Can apply all validation together.



Model Serializer: 
- The Model Serializer class provides a shortcut that lets you automatically 
create a serializer class with fields that corresponds to Model Fields. 
- It will automatically generate validators for the serializer, such as 
unique_together validators. 
- It includes simple default implementation of create() and update().  

How to write ModelSerializer class?

from rest_framework import Serializers 
class StudentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
	class Meta:
		model = Student
		fields = ['id', 'name', 'roll', 'city']

* fields = '__all__'  //to mention all fields 
* exclude = ['roll']  


Special arguments in ModelSerializer class fields: 
class StudentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
	name = serializers.CharField(read_only=True)
	class Meta:
		model = Student
		fields = ['id', 'name', 'roll', 'city']


// read_only=True doesn't allow you to update name field 

Another 2nd way: 
class StudentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
	class Meta:
		model = Student
		fields = ['id', 'name', 'roll', 'city']
		read_only = ['name','roll']

Another 3rd way:
class StudentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
	class Meta:
		model = Student
		fields = ['id', 'name', 'roll', 'city']
		extra_kwargs = {'name':{'read_only':True}}

Validation in ModelSerializer:
Validation steps remain same as in Serializer class.
Can use field level, object level, validatiors.
To use validators you need to write fields explicitly. 
	//name = serializers.CharField(vaildators = [start_with_r])
	//class Meta:
	//	model = Student
	//	fields = ['name','roll']



Function Based api_view 
This wrapper provide a few bits of functionality such as making sure you 
receive request instances in your view, and adding context to response
objects so that content negotiation can be performed. 
(content negotiation means sending data from sever depending on content type
	requested). 

The warpper also provide behaviour such as returning 405 method Not allowed
reponses when appropriate, and handling any ParseError exceptions that occur
when accessing request.data with malfunctioned input.

By default only get methods will be accepted. Other methods will respond 
with "405 Method Not Allowed."

How to write function based api_view? 
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view 
from rest_framework.responses import Response 
from rest_framework import status 

@api_view(['GET']) 
def student_list(request):
	if request.method == 'GET':
		stu = Student.objects.all()
	serializer = StudentSerializer(stu, many=True)
	return Response(serilaizer.data)

@api_view(['POST'])
def student_list(request):
	if request.method == 'POST':
		serializer = StudentSerializer(data= request.data)
		if serializer.is_valid():
			serializer.save()
			res = {'msg': 'Data Created'}
			return Reponse(res, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
		return Response(res, status = status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)

Can mention all request in one @api_view['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE']


Request:
Request Objects provides flexible request parsing, that allows to treat requests 
with json data or any other content type. 

request.data
request.data returns parsed content of the request body. 
It includes all parsed content, including file and non file inputs. 
It supports parsing the content of HTTP methods(POST,PUT,PATCH). 


request.method
request.method returns the uppercase string representation of the requests
HTTP method. 

request.query_params
request.query_params is more correctly named synonym for request.GET.
So use request.query_params instead of request.GET 
Any Http method may include query parameters, not just GET request. 


Response
Restframework supports HTTP content negotiation by providing Reponse class
which allows you to return content that can be rendered into multiple
content type, depending on the client request.

Response objects are intialized with data, which should consist of native
python datatype. REST framework then uses statdard HTTP content negotiation 
to determine how it should render the final response object. 

Reponse(data, status=None, template_name=None, headers=None, 
		content_type=None)

data: serialized/python data
status: A status code for the response. Defaults to 200
headers: A dictionary of HTTP headers to use in the reponse.
content_type: The content type of the reponse. Typically set automatically
	by the renderer determined by the content negotiation, but there
	may be some cases where you need to specify the content type
	explicitly. 

status_code:
status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED
status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST
 


Class Based APIView:
REST framework provides APIView class, which subclasses Django View class. 

APIView classes are different from regular View classes:
- Requests passed to the handler methods will be REST frameworks request
instances, not DJnago HttpRequest instances. 
- Handler methods may return REST frameworks Response, instead of Djangos
  HttpResponse. REST framework then uses statdard HTTP content negotiation 
  to determine how it should render the final response object. 
- Any APIException exceptions will be caught and add into responses.
- Incoming requests will be authenticated and appropriate permission and 
  throttle checks will be run before dispatching the request to the handler 
  method.

How to write class Based APIView?
from rest_framework.views import APIView
class StudentAPI(APIView):
	def get(self, request, format = None):
		stu = Student.objects.all()
		serializer = StudentSerializer(stu, many=True)
		return Response(serilaizer.data)

	def post(self, request, format = None):
		serializer = StudentSerializer(data= request.data)
		if serializer.is_valid():
			serializer.save()
			res = {'msg': 'Data Created'}
			return Reponse(res, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
		return Response(res, status = status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)



GenericAPIView:
This class subclasses APIView class.

Commonly used attributes in GenericAPIView class:
queryset - Used for returning objects from this view.
serilaizer_class - The serializer class used for API that does deserilzing input 
	and serialing output 



Mixins:
Common behaviour such as data to to be fetched, created, updated, deleted
is implemented in REST frameworks mixin classes. 
The mixin classes provide the action methods directly rather than defining
the handler methods, such as get(), post().

The mixin classes can be imported from rest_framework.mixins  

Types of Mixins classes:
ListModelMixin
CreateModelMixin
RetirveModelMixin
UpdateModelMixin
DestroyModelMixin

ListModelMixin
It provides a list(request, *args, **kwargs) method that retrives all
objects from query set. 
It returns a serialized data of the queryset as the body of the response.
If the serialized data is returned, this returns a 200 OK response. 
The response data may optionally be paginated.

from rest_framework.mixins import ListModelMixin
from rest_framework.generics import GenericAPIView
class StudentList(ListModelMixin, GenericAPIView):
	queryset = Student.objects.all()
	serializer_class = StudentSerializer
	
	def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
		return self.list(request, *args, **kwargs)


CreateModelMixin
It provides a create(request, *args, **kwargs) method, that creates and
saves a new model instance. 
If an object is created it returns 201 created Response.
If the request data provided is invalid, a 400 Bad request response will 
be returned, with the error details as the body of the response.

from rest_framework.mixins import CreateModelMixin
from rest_framework.generics import GenericAPIView
class StudenList(CreateModelMixin, GenericAPIView):
	queryset = Student.objects.all()
	serializer_class = StudentSerializer

	def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
		return self.create(request, *args, **kwargs)

ReteriveModelMixin
It provides a retrive(request, *args, **kwargs) method, that returns a 
specific existing model instance.
(ListModelMixin retturns all objects).
It returns a serialzed data of the query_object as the body of response.
If serailzed data is returned it return with 200 ok response.
If the request data is invalid, 404 Not found will be used. 

from rest_framework.mixins import retriveModelMixin
from rest_framework.generics import GenericAPIView
class StudentRetrive(RetriveModelMixin, GenricAPIView):
	queryset = Student.objects.all()
	serializer_class = StudentSerializer
	def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
		return self.retrive(request, *args, **kwargs)


UpdateModelMixin:
It provides a update(request, *args, **kwargs) method, that update existing
model instance.
It also provide a partial_update(request, *args, **kwargs) method, that 
is same as update, but all the fields requirement is optinal.
If object is updated the 200OK response is returned.
If the request data is invalid 400 Bad Request response will be returned.

from rest_framework.mixins import UpdateModelMixin
from rest_framework.generics import GenericAPIView
class StudentList(UpdateModelMixin, GenericAPIView):
queryset = Student.objects.all()
serializer_class = StudentSerilaizer
def put(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
	return self.update(request, *args, **kwargs) 

DestroyModelMixin:
It provides a destroy(request, *args, **kwargs) method, that deletes
existing model instance.
If an object is deleted this returns a 204 No Content Response, otherwise
it will return a 404 Not Found. 

from rest_framework.mixins  import DestroyModelMixin
from rest_framework.generics import GenricAPIView
class studentDestroy(DestroyModelMixin, GenericAPIView):
	queryset = Student.objects.all()
	serializer_class = StudentSerializer
	def delete(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
		return self.destroy(request, *args, **kwargs) 
 

Concrete API view classes:
It subclasses GenreicAPIView and relavant Mixins.
This API type is used when you dont require heavy customized behaviour.

The view classes can be imported from rest_framwork.generics.

class Types:
- ListAPIView (subclasses GenricAPIView + ListModelMixin)
- CreateAPIView (subclasses GenricAPIView + CreateModelMixin)
- RetriveAPIView (subclasses GenricAPIView + RetieveModelMixin)
- UpdateAPIView (subclasses GenricAPIView + UpdateModelMixin)
- DestroyAPIView (subclasses GenricAPIView + DestroyModelMixin)

Combined Shortcut classes:
- ListCreateAPIView
- RetriveUpdateAPIView
- RetriveDestroyAPIView
- RetriveUpdateDestroyAPIView 


ListAPIView: 
It is used for read-only endpoints. It resturns all objects in a queryset.
It provides a get method handler.

from rest_framework.genrics import ListAPIView
class StudentList(ListAPIView):
	queryset = Student.objects.all()
	serializer_class = StudentSerializer


CreateAPIView:
It is used for create-only endpoints. It provdes a post method handler.

from rest_framework.genrics import CreateAPIView
class StudentList(CreateAPIView):
	queryset = Student.objects.all()
	serializer_class = StudentSerializer

RetrieveAPIView:
It is used for read-only endpoints for a single model instance.
It provides get handler method.

UpdateAPIView:
It is used for update-only endpoints for a single model instance.
It provide put and patch handler method.

DestroyAPIView:
It is used for delete-only endpoints for a sigle model instance.
It provide delete handler method.




ViewSet:
Django REST framework allows you to combine the logic for a set of related
views in a single class, called a ViewSet. Meaning common behaviour such as 
data to be fetched, created, updated, deleted is handled in single class.

Adavantages of using a ViewSet over a View class? 
1) Repeated Logic can be combined into a single class. 
2) By using routers, we no longer need to deal with wiring up the the URL
   conf overself. 


ViewSet class:
It is a class based View, that doesnot provide handler methods 
instead provide action methods such as list(), create(), reterive(), 
update(), destroy(). 

How to write ViewSet Class?
from rest_framework import viewsets 
class StudentViewSet(viewsets.ViewSet):
	def list(self, request):
		stu = Student.objects.all()
		serialized_data = StudentSerializer(stu, many=True)
		return Response(serilaized_data.data, status= satus.HTTP_200_OK)

	def create(self, request): .. 
	def reterive(self,request,pk=None): ..
	def update(self,request,pk=None): ..
	def partial_update(self,request,pk=None): ..
	def destory(self,request,pk=None): ..


During dispatch, following attributes are available on the ViewSet:
- basename: The base to use for URL names that are created. 
- action: the name of the currnet action (e.g. list, create)
- detail: boolean indicating if the current action is configured for a 
list or detail view. When using pk its set to True, else False. 
- suffix: It is used to show title in browsable api page, to help 
developer understand what each view does. 
- name: the display name for the viewset. It is prefix to suffix attribute.
- description: Just for code documentation its used. 


Router: 
Router automatically genrates url patterns for your Viewset. This means you
dont have to write repetitive url patterns for your standard CRUD opertaions. 


Router config in Urls for ViewSet:
from restframework.routers import DefaultRouter 

router= DefaultRouter()
router.register('studentapi', views.StudentViewSet, basename='student')

urlpatterns= [
	path('', include(router.urls))
]

Api urls are determined automatically by the router. 


//basename is used for reverse Url lookups.
e.g.  student_url = reverse('student-detail', 
			kwargs={'pk': 1})

// This will give use url "/student/5/"



ModelViewSet Class:
It subclasses GenericAPIView and Mixin classes. 
The action method provided by the ModelViewSet class are list(), create(),
retrieve(), update(), partial_update(), destroy(). 

How to write Model ViewSet class?
from rest_framework import viewsets
class StudentModelViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
	queryset = Student.objects.all()
	serializer_class = StudentSerializer 

// Register StudentModelViewSet with router


ReadOnlyModelViewSet Class:
The ReadOnlyModelViewSet class also subclasses GenericAPIView. But unlike 
ModelViewSet it only include inplementation for read_only actions like 
list(), retrieve().

How to write ReadOnlyModelViewSet:
from rest_framework import viewsets
class StudentReadOnlyModelViewSet(views.ReadOnlyModelViewSet):
	queryset = Student.objects.all()
	serilaizer_class = StudentSerializer 

Why use Authentication & Permisssion?
Currently our API doesnt have any restrictions on who can edit or delete
data.
Adding Aunthetication and Permisssion make sure that:
- Only authenticated users may create data. 
- Only the creator of a data may update or delete it. 
- Unauthenticated requests should have full read-only access.

Authentication:
Authentication is the meachanism of associting incoming request with as set 
of indetifying credentials, such as user from request came from, or the
token that it was signed with. The permission and throttling policies can 
then use those credentials to determine if the request should be permited. 

Authentication is always run at the very start of the view, before the
permission and throttling checks occur, and before any other code is
allowed to execute.

Rest framework provides a number of authentication schemes:
-BasicAuthentication
-SessionAuthentication
-TokenAuthentication
-RemoteUserAuthetication
-Custom authetication

BasicAuthentication: 
-BasicAuthentication cross checks username and password.
-Appropriate for testing not for productionising.
-If the user is successfully autheticated, Basic Authetication provides the 
following crendentials:
request.user //will be django User instance 
request.auth //will be None

-If basic authentication fails, then request wont have valid credentials and 
permissions will be denied.
-This results into HTTP 401 Unauthorised response.


Permissions:
Permissions help control which users can access which API endpoints or views.
Perissions checks are always performed at the very start after 
authentication done.
Permission checks uses authentication information like request.user and 
request.auth properties to determine if incoming request to be permitted. 

Permission classes: 
Permission in in views are always defined as a list of permission
classes. e.g.:  permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated, IsAdminUser]
- AllowAny
- IsAuthenticated
- IsAdminUser
- IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly
- DjanoModelPermissions
- DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnonReadOnly
- CustomPermissions


AllowAny:
The AllowAny permission class will allow unrestricted access, regardless of 
if the request is authenticated or unauthenticated. 
You can accheive the same result by using the empty permission list, but
using this just makes the intention clear.

IsAuthenticated:
IsAuthenticated will deny permission to any unauthenticated user.
This permission is suitable if you want your API to only be accessible to 
registerd users.

IsAdminUser:
IsAmdinUser class will deny permissions to any user, unless user.is_staff is 
True. 
This permission is suitable if you want your API to only be accessible to 
a subset of trusted adminstartors. 


types of users: 
-normal user
-admin user(staff status == True)
-superuser(staff status == True, super status = True)

How to apply authentication and permission in classs? 
from rest_framework.authetication import BasicAuthentication
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated 
class StudentModelViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
	authentication_classes = [BasicAuthentication]
	permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
	..

How to define globally if you have multiple view classes? 
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
	'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': ['rest_framework.authentication.
						BasicAuthentication'],
	'DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS_CLASSES':['rest_framework.permissions.
						IsAuthenticated']
}


SessionAuthentication:
-This Authentication scheme uses Djangos default session for authentication. 
-If successfully authenticated, sessionAuthentication provide following 
credentials: 
request.user //will be django User instance 
request.auth //will be None

-If the sessionAuthentication fails then request wont have valid creadentials 
and permssions will be denied.
-This results into HTTP 403 Forbidden response. 


//Unlike BasicAuthentication, SessionAuthentication does not provide prompt
//for username and password.
To loginin from browsable api we will use rest_framworks built in urls.
Within urls write: 
path('auth', include('rest_framework.urls')) 


IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly:
This permission scheme will allow authenticated users to perform any request.
Resquests from unauthenticated users will only be permitted if the request 
if one of the "safe" methods (GET, HEAD OR OPTIONS).

This permission is suitable if you want your api to allow read permissions to 
anonymous users, and only write permissions to authenticated users. 


DjangoModelPermissions:
This permsision scheme is tied up with django.contrib.auth model permissions.
Permission will only be granted if the user iauthenticated and have the 
releavant model pemrissions.

POST requests require the user to have the add permissions on the model.
PUT and PATCH requests require the user to have the change permission on the 
model. 
DELETE request require the user to have the delete pemission on the model. 

// We can give model permsision by login in admin and from Users section 
// can provide user relavant model permissions.

This permission is more powerful, it can restrict specific user from 
permitting any model permsission. 


DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnonReadOnly:
This permission scheme allows autheticated users to perform any request.
Requests from unauthticated users will only be permitted if the requet if 
on of the 'safe' methods('GET', 'HEAD' OR 'OPTIONS').


Custom Permissions:
To implement custom pemrissions overide BasePermission and implement either,
or both of the following methods:
- has_permission(self, request, view)
- has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj)

This method must return True if the request should be granted access and
False otherwise.

How to write custom Permissions?
create a seprate file custompermissions.py in app.
from rest_framework.permissions import BasePermission

class MyPermission(BasePermission):
	def has_permission(self,request,view):
		if request.method == 'GET':
			return True
		else: 
			return False

giving only get request access.
		

Authentication and permission in Function based api view?
from rest_framwork.decorators import api_view, authetication_classes, 
	permission_classes
from rest_framework.authentication import BasicAuthentication
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated

@api_view(['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'])
@authetication_classes([BasicAuthentication])
@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])
def studentapi(request, pk = None):
	if request.method == 'GET':
		..

Token Authentication:
This authentication scheme uses simple token-based HTTP authentication.
To use the TokenAuthentication include it in authetication classes inside
view.
Additionally include rest_framework.authtoken in your installed_apps 
settings.py
	Installed_apps = [ 'rest_framework.authtoken' ]

Make sure to run migrate after change in settings.py, as .authtoken
provide migrations to create Token Table.

If successfully authenticated, TokenAuthentication provides the following
credentials.
request.user will be a Django User instance.
request.auth will be rest_framework.authtoken.models.token instance

-If the TokenAuthentication fails then request wont have valid creadentials 
and permssions will be denied.
-This results into HTTP 401 Unauthorized response. 

To use tokenAuthentication we require token.

How to Generate Token ?
- Using Admin Application
    After migartion Token table is create. Via admin panel can easily
    create token.
- Using Django manage.py command
    python manage.py drf_create_token username
- By exposing an API endpoint
    With this user himself can create his token and can use the api.
- Using Signals 
	when you create user it creates token at the same time.
	Implementation skipped for now.

How to Generate Token: By exposing an API endpoint?
User obtain a token by providing username and password.
REST framework provides obtain_auth_token built-in view to provide this 
behaviour.
How to use obtain_auth_token view? 
from rest_framework.authtoken.views import obtain_auth_token
urlpatterns = [
	path('gettoken/', obtain_auth_token)
]

obtain_auth_token will return JSON_response when valid username and password
is given.
e.g.: 
http POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/gettoken/ username='name' password='pass'


//can also use CustomAuthToken class from django documentaion, uses same 
obtain_auth_token.


HTTPie
HTTPie is a commandline tool. Its goal is to make command line 
interaction with web services. 
It provide http command which allows sending HTTP requests using simple
syntax.
HTTPie can be used for testing, debugging and generally interacting with 
HTTP server.

syntax: http [flags] [METHOD] URL [ITEM [ITEM]]

- pip install httpie

GET Request:
http http://127.0.0.1:8000/studentapi/

GET Request with Auth
http http://127:0.0.1:8000/studentapi/ Authroization:"Token 621hbvdjsbvjak"

POST Request
http -f POST http://127:0.0.1:8000/studentapi/ name=Jay roll=104 city=Dhanbad
	Authroization:"Token 621hbvdjsbvjak"

PUT Request
http PUT http://127:0.0.1:8000/studentapi/4/ name=Amit roll=105 city=Dhanbad
	Authroization:"Token 621hbvdjsbvjak"

DELETE Request
http DELETE http://127:0.0.1:8000/studentapi/4/ 
	Authorization:"Token 621hbvdjsbvjak"



JSON Web Token Authentication:
It is a third party package and not provided by DRF.
It can be used for token based Authentication.
Unlike builtin TokenAuthentication JWT Authentication doesnt need to use a 
database to validate token.

Earlier whenever user made HTTP request token was validated by querying with
db. Which can created performance issues when we have multiple users. 

Simple JWT:
It provides a JSON web Token authentication backend for DRF.

pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt

How to configure Simple JWT?
Settings.py
// Globally setup
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
	'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES: 
	    ('rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication')
}

//locally setup in views.py
from rest_frmawork_simplejwt.authentication import JWTAuthentication
authentication_classes = [JWTAuthentication]

urls.py
from rest_framework_simplejwt.views import TokenObtainPairView, 
			TokenRefreshView, TokenVerifyView

urlpatterns = [
     path('gettoken/', TokenObtainView.as_view(), name='token_obtain_pair'),
     path('refreshtoken/', TokenRefreshView.as_view(), name='refresh_token'),
     path('verifytoken/', TokenVerify.as_view(), name='verify_token')

]

JWT Default Settings:
settings.py
from datetime import timedelta
SIMPLE_JWT = {
	'ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(minutes=5), 
	'REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(days=1),
	'ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKENS': False, 
	//when set True it rgenerates both new access, refersh token
	// otherwise genrate only access token.
}

How to use JWT?
syntax: http [flags] [METHOD] URL [ITEM [ITEM]]
GET Token
http POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/gettoken/ username=Amit password=1234

Verify Token
http POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/verifytoken/ token=jvdnvldnslkvndksnvkndsn

Refresh Token
http POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/refreshtoken/ refresh=mvsmvdsvdsnvdsnvdnk

Flow: 
You will do gettoken when user is registered and want to access an API.
But since we are using JWT he need to genrate token.
to genrate token he will make request to gettoken with username and password.
This will return access, refresh token.
Now suppose access token gets expired after 5 mins then genrate new access
token with help of refersh token.
 

Access token structure:
Its divided into three parts. 
- Header  //contains type of token Authetication used and algorithm 
	e.g.: {type:'jwt', alg:'HS256'}
- Payload
	e.g.: {
		token_type: 'access',	//type of token 
		exp_date: 20/12/24,     //expiry date for token
		jti: 'hdjvkbdsjbvdkjs', //unique id for token 		
		user_id: 2 //user for whom token is genrated
	}
- Signature //gives encoding information


How to make HTTP request to server?
GET:
http http://127.0.0.1:8000/studntapi/ "Authorization:Bearer bjdsfjdwnwdjfsjk"
POST:
http -f POST http://127:0.0.1:8000/studentapi/ name=Amit roll=101 
	city=Mumbai "Authorization:Bearer dsvcjdsnvdnslnvdslnjdbvd"

PUT: 
http -f PUT http://127:0.0.1:8000/studentapi/2 name=Anket roll=102 
	city=Mumbai "Authorization:Bearer dsvcjdsnvdnslnvdslnjdbvd"
DELETE:
http -f DELETE http://127:0.0.1:8000/studentapi/2 'Authorization:Bearer dsvcjdsnvdnslnvdslnjdbvd'


Throttling: 
Throttling is used to control rate of requests that client can make to an 
API.
Your API might have restrictive throttle for unauhenticated requests and less 
restrictive throttle for authenticated requests.


How to configure throttling in settings.py?
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
	'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES':[
		'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',
		'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle',
	],
	
	'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES':[
		'anon':'100/day',
		'user':'1000/day',
	]
}

throttling classes:
AnonRateThrottle
It will throttle against unauthenticated requests.
The IP address is used to generate a throttle key whom against throttle is 
performed.
The rate of requests can be defined using one of the following way:
-By overidding AnonRateThrottle class. Done by creating another class 
 and setting rate e.g.: 
	from rest_framework.throttling import AnonRateThrottle
	class CustomAnonRateThrottle(AnonRateThrottle):
	    rate = '10/min' 
	
	// this is 1st method to override. Another is write scope e.g.: 
	// scope = 'jack' then define jack rate limit in settings.py 
		DEFAULT_THOTTLE_RATES:{
		'jack' : '5/min'
		}

-By configuring dafault setting in setings.py. e.g.:
	DEFAULT_THOTTLE_RATES:{
		'anon' : '10/min'
}

UserRateThrottle
It will throttle against users with give rate of request.
For authenticated users user_id is used to form throttle key and for
unauthenticated users ip_address is used to form throttle key.
The rate of requests can be defined using one of the following way:
-By overidding AnonRateThrottle class.
-By configuring dafault setting in setings.py. e.g.:
	DEFAULT_THOTTLE_RATES:{
		'user' : '10/min'
}

ScopedRateThrottle
It will throttle against specific part of an api.
The throttle is performed only if the view contains throttle_scope property.
The scope of the view and ipaddress or user_id is used to generate throttle
key.
The rate of request can be defined using throttle_scope.

How to implement trottling using AnonRateThrottle and UserRateThrottle? 
-Just like permission classes you can define thottle classes and rate of 
request can be overidden or deined in settings.py.

from rest_framework.throttling import AnonRateThrottle, UserRateThrottle
from rest_framework import view_sets
class StudentAPIViewSet(viewsets.ViewSet):
	query_set = Student.objects.all()
	serializer_class = StudentSerializer
	throttle_classes = [AnonRateThrottle, ScopedRateThrottle]

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
	'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES':{
		'anon': '2/day',
		'user': '2/day'
	}
}
 

How to implement trottling using ScopedRateThrottle? 
from rest_framework.throttling import ScopedRateThrottle
from rest_framework.generics import ListAPIView, CreateAPIView
class GETStudentData(ListAPIView):
	query_set = Student.objects.all()
	serializer_class = StudentSerializer
	throttle_classes = [ScopedRateThrottle]
	throttle_scope = 'get_data_scope' 

class CreateStudentData(CreateAPIView):
	query_set = Student.objects.all()
	serializer_class = StudentSerializer
	throttle_classes = [ScopedRateThrottle]
	throttle_scope = 'create_data_scope' 


REST_FRAMEWORK = {
	'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES':{
		'get_Data_scope': '4/day'
		'create_data_scope': '2/day'
	}
}



Filtering: 
The simplest way to filter the query_Set of any view that subclasses
GenericAPIView is to override the get_queryset() method.

When to use filtering? 
Suppose there is college website and each teacher have a separate portal to 
uplaod marks of his students.so, when teacher logins he must see only his 
student marks. 
So, in backend the query set must be filter out particular subject student 
marks.

Other examples: 
There is shopping website and each seller has a separate portal. In which he 
must see only those items he has pblished. 
 
With get_queryset(self) we can apply filter on records.

How to implement get_queryset() method?
-suppose have Student(id,name,roll,city,passby) table. passby will have
teacher name who passed student in her subject. 
We have to filter records to specific subject for the teacher logged in.

from rest_framework.generics import ListAPIView
class StudentListView(ListAPIView):
	queryset = Student.Objects.all()
	serializer_class = StudentSerialzier
	def get_queryset(self):
		user = self.request.user
		return Student.objects.filter(passby=user)


- Wrong method
class StudentListView(ListAPIView):
	user = request.user
	queryset = Student.Objects.filter(passby=user)

- you cant do this to filter records for multiple reasons: 
- this way queryset will be deined only once during class intilaisation 
  and wont chnage when new api request is made. But get_queryset(self) is 
  triggered for every new rquest.
- request.user is not accessible directly like this. 
 correct way to access request.user ? 
 To access request.user
 override get method
	 def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
		user = self.request.user
 can also overide get_queryset like above to access self.request.user

GenericFiltering:
REST framework also includes support for generic filtering backend that 
allows you to easily construct complex searches and filters.

DjangoFilterBackend
The django-filter library includes a DjangoFilterBackend class which supports
highly customizable field filtering for REST framework.

How to cofigure django-filter library 
pip install django-filter 

INSTALLED_APPS = [
	'django_filters',
]

Gloabal setting:
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
	'DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS':
	['django_filter.rest_framework.DjangoFilterBackend']
}

- You can set the filter backends on a per_view, or per_viewset basis.

How to use DjangoFilterBackend in view?
from django_filters.rest_framework import DjangoFilterBackend
class StudentListView(ListAPIView):
	queryset = Student.Objects.all()
	serializer_class = StudentSerializer
	filter_backends = [DjangoFilterBackend]

- If you want to perform simple equality based filtering, you can set 
filter_fields attribute and include fileds in list which you want to filter
against. e.g.:
	filterset_fields = ['name', 'city']


How the request must come to apply filter?
http://127.0.0.1:8000/studentapi/?name=Amit&city=Mumbai


SearchFilter
The SearchFilter class supports single query parameter based 
searching.
If you want to perform SearchFilter, you can set search_fields attribute
and include fields in list which you want to filter against.

How to use SearchFilter? 
from rest_framework.filters import SearchFilter
class StudentListView(ListAPIView):
	queryset = Student.Objects.all()
	serializer_class = StudentSerializer
	filter_backends = [SearchFilter]
	search_fields = ['name','city']

How the request must come to apply filter?
http://127.0.0.1:8000/studentapi/?search=Mumbai
- this lookups using icontains in both name and city 

Different ways for text search in SearchFilter?
-'^' Starts with matches
-'=' Exact matches
-'@' full text search
-'$' Regex Search

e.g.: search_fields = ['^name']
http://127.0.0.1:8000/studentapi/?search=r


OrderingFilter
OrderingFilter class supports simple query paramater based controlled 
ordering of results.
e.g.: 
http://127.0.0.1:8000/studentapi/?ordering=name

- for reverse ordering use prefix '-'
http://127.0.0.1:8000/studentapi/?ordering=-name

- for multiple ordering
http://127.0.0.1:8000/studentapi/?ordering=name,city

If you want to perform OrderingFilter, you can set ordering_fields attribute
and incldue fields in the list which you want to filter against.

How to use OrderingFilter?
from rest_framework.filters import OrderingFilter
class StudentListView(ListAPIView):
	queryset = Student.Objects.all()
	serializer_class = StudentSerializer
	filter_backends = [OrderingFilter]
	ordering_fields = ['name','city']

- if want order against all fields can write '__all__'


Pagination
REST Framework supports customizable pagination.
This allows you to modify how large result sets are split into indvidual 
pages of data.

DRF provides three types of pagination style:
- PageNumberPagination
- LimitOffsetPagination
- CursorPagination 

PageNumberPagination
This pagination style splits large results into individual pages data.
Just like a book. 
-page attribute decides which page to be shown 
-page_size decides how many records to be shown

Global config for PageNumberPagination
The pagination can be set globally using DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS and 
PAGE_SIZE.

REST_FRAMEWORK={
	'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS': 
		'rest_framework.pagination.PageNumberPagination',
	'PAGE_SIZE': 5
}

Pagination in api view can be set using pagination_class attribute.
from rest_framework.pagination import PageNumberPagination
class StudentListView(ListAPIView):
	queryset = Student.Objects.all()
	serializer_class = StudentSerializer
	pagination_class = PageNumberPagination


- If want to have customize pagination for specfic view can override 
PageNumberPagination. Create new file customize_pagination.py.

from rest_framework.pagination import PageNumberPagination
class MypageNumberPagination(PageNumberPagination):
	page_size = 10
	page_query_param = 'p'       
	page_size_query_param = 'records'
	max_page_size = 7
	last_page_strings = 'end'

page_query_param = 'p' will rename page to p studentapi/?p=2
page_size_query_param = 'records' will give range of records in page 
			studentapi/?page=2&records=10
max_page_size = 7 even if you give ?page=2&records=10 it will show max
		records 7 
last_page_strings = 'end' will show records on last page 
			studentapi/?page=end
		by default its set to 'last' keyword

How to make request with parameter?
http://127.0.0.1:8000/studentapi/?page=2


LimitOffsetPagination
This pagination method control how many records to show and where to start
from.
- limit attribute defines how many records to be shown 
- offset attribute defines from which record to start

Global and local configuration remains same as PageNumberPagination.

How to make request with parameter?
http://127.0.0.1:8000/studentapi/?limit=4&offset=6

How to write customize LimitOffsetPagination for specific view?
class MyLimitOffsetPagination(LimitOffsetPagination):
	default_limit = 5
	offset_query_param = 'myoffset' // just renames like page_query_param
	max_limit = 6 


CursorPagination
This pagination method doesnot make use of page numbers or offset. Instead it
uses cursor to keep track of current position in result set.
- Works only in one direction (next/previous) and cannot jump to specific 
	page.
- Requires unique and unchanging field (usually timestamp like create_at
	field) to keep order consistent.
- Default setting is by the newest first -created_at.


Global and local configuration remains same as PageNumberPagination.

How to write customize CursorPagination for specific view?
class MyCursorPagination(CursorPagination):
	page_size = 5
	ordering = 'name'  // default is created_at field
	cursor_query_param = 'cu' // just renames like page_query_param 


Serializer Relationship:
Sometimes models are linked to each other through relationships like 
ForeignKey, OneToOneField, ManyToManyField.
When we serialize these models we need a way to represent the relationship
in the API Response. This is called serailizer relationship.

e.g.: 
class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE,
				related_name = 'book')

Each book has one author. This means book model is linked with author model.
Now when we create api for the Author model we must decide how to represnt 
the book field in JSON ouput.

Use PrimaryKeyRelatedField if you only need the author's ID.
      book = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(many=True, read_only=True)
Use StringRelatedField if you want the author's name.
	book = serializers.StringRelatedField(many=True, read_only=True)
Use SlugRelatedField if the author has a unique identifier like a username.
	book = serializers.SlugRelatedField(many=True, read_only=True, 
				slug_field = 'title')
Use HyperlinkedRelatedField if you want a clickable link to the author.
 This will give all the book links.
     book = serializers.HyperlinkedRelatedField(many=True, read_only=True, 
			view_name = 'book-detail')

HyperLinkedIdentityField gives link to only one book
    book = serializers.HyperlinkedRelatedField(view_name = 'book-detail')




HyperLinkedModelSerializer
This model is same as ModelSerializer except that it uses Hyperlinks 
rather than primary keys. 
It gives additional field url which is a link to details of the record.

How to write HyperLinkedModelSreialzier?
class StudentSreialzier(serialziers.HyperLinkedModelSerializer):
	class Meta:
		model = Student
		fields = ['id', 'url', 'name', 'roll', 'city']

extra info: 
If want to see what all fields any serialer provides then use repr().
python manage.py shell 
from api.serializers import StudentSerializer
serialzier = StudentSerialzier()
print(repr(serializer))
	id = IntegerField()
	url = HyperlinkedIndetifyField()
	name = CharField()
	roll = IntegerField()
	city = CharField()


Nested Serializer
A nested serialzier means using one serializer inside another serialzier. 
This helps when you want related data to be included in single API response.

How to implement nested Serializer? 

models.py 
class Singer(models.Model):
	name = models.CharField(max_length = 800)
	gender = mdoels.CharField(max_length = 800)

class Song(models.Model):
	title = models.CharField(max_length = 800)
	duration = models.CharField(max_length = 800)
	singer = models.ForeignKey(Singer, on_delete = models.CASCADE, 
				related_name = 'sungby')

serializer.py
class SongSerializer(serialziers.ModelSerialzier):
	class Meta:
		model = song
		fields = ['id', 'title', 'duration', 'singer']	


class SingerSerialzier(serialzier.ModelSerializer):
	sungby = SongSerilaizer(many=True, read_only=True)
	class Meta:
		model  = Singer
		fields = ['id', 'name', 'gender', 'sungby']


// with the sungby field we are perfroming nested serializer resulting into 
data with both singer and his all songs.
